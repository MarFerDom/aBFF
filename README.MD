# ABOUT FEATURES
## FEATURES EXTRACTION
- NB-15 extracts features from Argus and Zeek programs. featuresNB15.py joins with label file provided by the pcap source and calculates 12 extra features as described in (Moustafa et al 2015).
- CICFlowMeter extracts CIC features. featuresCIC.py joins with label file provided by the pcap source and adds Flow ID.

# SOURCE PCAP

AB-TRAP (bonafide) is extracted from MAWILab by filering with labeled file provided by the pcap source.
bonafide is split for processing in Argus/Zeek. Files must be joined before calculating group features.
attack is generated by simulation and each ip represents an attack category.
attack and bonafide datasets must be joined at the end.
attacks and traffic occur separatedly in time.

UNSW-NB15 label file NUSW-NB15_GT.csv is provided by the pcap source.
CIC-IDS2017 label files in GeneratedLabelledFlows.zip are provided by the pcap source.

## 0_get_CIC_from_labels.py 

Use CIC label files as "CIC"_CIC.csv in case 



## 1_Extract_Features.sh [inputDirectory] 

> Generates files for later extraction of dataset features
> Requires: Argus, Zeek, cicflowmeter.py

- Argus: [sudo apt-get install argus-server] OR http://qosient.com/argus/src/argus-3.0.8.2.tar.gz
- Zeek: https://download.zeek.org/zeek-4.1.1.tar.gz
- CICFlowMeter: [sudo python3 -m pip install cicflowmeter] OR
- [git clone https://github.com/CanadianInstituteForCybersecurity/CICFlowMeter.git]

Creates inner directory per pcap file and runs Argus, Zeek and CICFlowMeter on all PCAP files in current directory.

NOTE_1: For running MAWILab and CIC-IDS through CICFlowMeter it was necessary to force linktype to 1 [EN10MB(Ethernet)] in utils.py as: https://www.tcpdump.org/linktypes.html
NOTE_2: Remember to edit /home/YOUR_USER/.local/lib/python3.9/site-packages/scapy/utils.py

```
import numpy
 
def __truediv__(self, other):
	type: (_Decimal) -> EDecimal
	return EDecimal(Decimal.__truediv__(self, Decimal(numpy.float64(other))))

GET ALT -> if(): else: linktype = 1
```
